Project was imported and originally made for CS 2340 (Computer Architecture) with Professor Nhut Nguyen.

Thoughts: Originally made in MARS MIPS simulator. Was probably the hardest project I did in my freshman college year. I even had to make a project report and manual. I do
remember the relief and satisfaction of finishing it after working on it for several hours straight was something like experiencing an all-time coding high.
